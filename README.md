# Real-Time-Emotion-Based-Frequency-Recommendation-System
A project that detects emotion using a webcam and recommends a frequency based on the emotion
This project is a real-time system that detects emotions from facial expressions using a live camera feed and predicts a personalized frequency recommendation based on various factors, including the detected emotion, gender, time, location, weather, activity, feedback, age, mood intensity, and sleep quality. The recommended frequency is then played on an online tone generator for practical use.
